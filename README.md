# Implementation of a simple E-Business System for Wholesalers with product data management functionality

This system is able to import product catalogs from suppliers. 
Furthermore, the system is able to export the product catalog of a supplier to his customers. 

The implementation is based on a running E-Business system (the WholesalerWebDemo) which
is based on the E-Business Software Framework (EBSF).
